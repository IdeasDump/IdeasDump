I want to grow everyday -- but that can be very hard. I like to smoke grass and read about math stuff all day. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and hopefully as M.S. in Applied Mathematics at some point. I work on the Math/PDE team at a company that developes mathematical computing software.
