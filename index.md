## Welcome to our Ideas!

We are Matt and Davis; two university grads looking to change the world!

# Davis

A perpetual victim of finding everything just fascinating, I ended up with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering while completing 4/5 courses for a philosophy minor. Having studied abroad in Iceland during my junior winter break, I spent a semester in Reykjavik studying Sustainable Energy Engineering. Turns out living in the middle of the Atlantic is pretty isolating, and I've returned to the US to work for a medical device R&D firm.

I would like to continue my graduate studies soon, although balancing this with a full-time job will be tricky. If I had it my way, I'd study computational modeling and simulation full-time, then work for the National Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado. In reality, I should study something relevant to what I'm doing at work so I can get a raise, so that I can support myself studying full-time, then work at NREL.

Removing myself from the world of robots, my hobbies range from pickup basketball, playing trumpet, building keyboards, hiking, photography, to that good vidya. I often wonder if I'm happy doing what I'm doing, considering that I enjoy all these activities enough to spend my life doing them. I can imagine myself hiring a personal basketball trainer and working my way through local leagues to get to semi-pro. I can imagine myself starting a small keyboard design LLC and shipping out custom orders. I see people who chase their dreams and hobbies, and my initial gut response is "Can't be me". Performing my job to a satisfactory level and unwinding afterwards takes up a great deal of my energy, and devoting additional effort to pursuing something that doesn't have immediate incentives is a tough ask.

Thus is the cycle I am stuck in.

I've been drawn towards more pure mathematics lately to expand my knowledge base. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and hopefully a M.S. in Applied Mathematics soon. I work on the Math/PDE team at a company that develops mathematical computing software.

Undergraduate STEM degrees provide a broad survey of many disciplines, but I want to specialize. Earlier I had gained interest in quantum computation, particularly with circuit optimizations, and the deeper mathematics has encouraged me to pursue more rigorous analysis tools.
