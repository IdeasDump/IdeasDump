I'd really like to head over to Europe for some remote work. Not sure exactly where, but I am in desperate need of new environments and people. The Northeast is great, but I get too comfortable and caught in my ways. I've considered moving more towards the Boston area for the energy of a younger crowd, but part of me is scared of that. Who cares. It would be good for me.
