I've been sniped by problem A4 off the 2021 Putnam: 

>Let
$I(R) = \iint_{x^2+y^2 \le R^2} (\frac{1+2x^2}{1+x^4+6x^2y^2+y^4} - \frac{1+y^2}{2+x^4+y^4})dxdy$
>
>Find
$\lim_{R \to \infty} I(R)$</center>
or show that this limit does not exist

Is this just evaluating an integral or is there more? We can see the bounds are constrained by a circle with radius $R$. If we think of the integrand as a surface, perhaps there is a geometric solution we can derive. Admittedly I've already viewed the solution, but it seemingly did not provide a direct geometric analysis so I'd like to find my own.

Indeed, this is a symmetry was used to split the integral so I've somehow convinced myself there is a more intuitive solution if we can formulate the problem a different way. 

This problem does not necessarily require us to evaluate the integral if we can think of a more geometric proof to bound the limit (if possible).

To start, lets define the function $f(x,y)$ to be the integrand, and consider its surface $S\in\mathbb{R^2}$ when evaluated at all points $(x, y)$. We know $f$ is smooth, continous and has odd parity.


In the context of real analysis a set in Euclidean space is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Let's find the discriminate.
