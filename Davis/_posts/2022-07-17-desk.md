title: Desk Setup Planning
---

With my admission to an online master's program, two roommates moving out of the house I live in, and a desire to change things up, I am interested in a new desk setup. I will be choosing components to emphasize productivity while accommodating baseline gaming performance.

Since entering high school in 2013, I've been deeply in-tune with the art of [battlestations](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/): the combination of one's PC with their peripherals. Although nearly every first-world citizen either owns or interacts with these devices on a daily basis, there is a thriving enthusiast community with members desperately attempting to differentiate themselves from the crowd. This desire for finding oneself results in each device becoming a niche within itself. Are you a mechanical keyboard guy? Do you prefer double monitors or an ultrawide? Open-back or closed-back headphones? Here I will be listing tentative choices for my next desk setup while providing my rationale. 

# Monitor

Arguably the most important peripheral, different monitor setups will result in wildly different experiences. Upon building my first PC, I jumped straight to a double monitor setup, valuing the ability to watch a YouTube video while playing some vidya. With my next upgrade, I naturally progressed to a triple monitor setup with all in landscape. After experimenting with a portrait-landscape-portrait (PLP) setup, I found the PLL arrangement to be the best fit for me. This allowed for background videos to play fullscreen on my right monitor while a vertical webpage or text editor is on the left monitor. Recently, I've been unable to run triple monitors due to desk constraints, so I've been using a dual landscape monitor setup as of late, which are described below.

## Current 

My current monitors are the [Dell S2719DGF](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-27-Inch-LED-Lit-Monitor-S2719DGF/dp/B00N2L5CXO/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1LOPMXESHQ8PL&keywords=dell+27+inch+monitor+2560+x+1440+144hz&qid=1658073513&s=electronics&sprefix=dell+27+inch+monitor+2560+x+1440+144hz%2Celectronics%2C64&sr=1-4) (primary) and [Dell P2419HC](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-P2419HC-Monitor-Full-1080P/dp/B07GBY2M8V/ref=dp_prsubs_1?pd_rd_i=B07GBY2M8V&psc=1) (secondary). These have served me well in a gaming-centric setup, with the S2719DGF having a 2560x1440p 144 Hz panel and NVIDIA G-SYNC, and the P2419HC matching the slim bezel aesthetic. However, after trying the [Lenovo G34w-10](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-G34w-10-34-Inch-Curved-Monitor/dp/B084R2XYM9) ultrawide while in Iceland, I am convinced that the ultrawide master race is real. Below I've listed loose requirements for my desired monitor

## Requirements

### Display size

  * 34-40" (curved preferred)

Having tried a 34" ultrawide panel, I thought I could use a bit more screen real estate to better emulate a triple monitor arrangement. 34" didn't feel quite enough to have three windows up side-by-side at my desired text size, so I will be leaning towards 38 and 40" options.
  
### Resolution

  * 3440x1440p and up

3440x1440p is an industry standard for 21:9 ultrawides, so I will not accept anything lower.

### Aspect ratio

  * 21:9 (or other ultrawide)

21:9 is the standard aspect ratio for ultrawide monitors, but [alternative aspect ratios such as 32:9 exist](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-49-inch-Odyssey-FreeSync-LC49G95TSSNXZA/dp/B088HH6LW5?th=1), although these come at a high premium.

### Refresh rate
 
  * 75 Hz minimum (120+ Hz preferred)

 I was introduced to high refresh rate monitors in 2015 (?) when I bought the [Acer XG270HU 27" 1440p 144 Hz monitor](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-XG270HU-27-inch-FREESYNC-Widescreen/dp/B00VRCLHYS). I am now forever spoiled by high refresh rates, and will not accept lower than 75 Hz on a primary monitor.

### I/O

  * DisplayPort 2.0
  * Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C)
  * Monitor USB hub minimum, KVM switch ideal

I would like this monitor to be used for my desktop and my laptop, which will use the DisplayPort and Thunderbolt 4 inputs respectively. These protocols should support the max resolution and refresh rate at the same time. With a KVM (keyboard video mouse) switch to use the same peripherals between my desktop and laptop, switching between my desktop, personal and work laptops should be seamless.
