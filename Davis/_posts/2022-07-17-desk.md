title: Desk Setup Planning
---

With my admission to an online master's program, two roommates moving out of the house I live in, and a desire to change things up, I am interested in a new desk setup. I will be choosing components to emphasize productivity while accommodating baseline gaming performance.

Since entering high school in 2013, I've been deeply in-tune with the art of [battlestations](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/): the combination of one's PC with their peripherals. Although nearly every first-world citizen either owns or interacts with these devices on a daily basis, there is a thriving enthusiast community with members desperately attempting to differentiate themselves from the crowd. This desire for finding oneself results in each device becoming a niche within itself. Are you a mechanical keyboard guy? Do you prefer double monitors or an ultrawide? Open-back or closed-back headphones? Here I will be listing tentative choices for my next desk setup while providing my rationale. 

# Monitor

Arguably the most important peripheral, different monitor setups will result in wildly different experiences. Upon building my first PC, I jumped straight to a double monitor setup, valuing the ability to watch a YouTube video while playing some vidya. With my next upgrade, I naturally progressed to a triple monitor setup with all in landscape. After experimenting with a portrait-landscape-portrait (PLP) setup, I found the PLL arrangement to be the best fit for me. This allowed for background videos to play fullscreen on my right monitor while a vertical webpage or text editor is on the left monitor. Recently, I've been unable to run triple monitors due to desk constraints, so I've been using a dual landscape monitor setup as of late, which are described below.

## Current 

My current monitors are the [Dell S2719DGF](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-27-Inch-LED-Lit-Monitor-S2719DGF/dp/B00N2L5CXO/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1LOPMXESHQ8PL&keywords=dell+27+inch+monitor+2560+x+1440+144hz&qid=1658073513&s=electronics&sprefix=dell+27+inch+monitor+2560+x+1440+144hz%2Celectronics%2C64&sr=1-4) (primary) and [Dell P2419HC](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-P2419HC-Monitor-Full-1080P/dp/B07GBY2M8V/ref=dp_prsubs_1?pd_rd_i=B07GBY2M8V&psc=1) (secondary). These have served me well in a gaming-centric setup, with the S2719DGF having a 2560x1440p 144 Hz panel and NVIDIA G-SYNC, and the P2419HC matching the slim bezel aesthetic. However, after trying the [Lenovo G34w-10](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-G34w-10-34-Inch-Curved-Monitor/dp/B084R2XYM9) ultrawide while in Iceland, I am convinced that the ultrawide master race is real. Below I've listed loose requirements for my desired monitor

## Requirements

### Display size

  * 34-40" (curved preferred)

Having tried a 34" ultrawide panel, I thought I could use a bit more screen real estate to better emulate a triple monitor arrangement. 34" didn't feel quite enough to have three windows up side-by-side at my desired text size, so I will be leaning towards 38 and 40" options.
  
### Resolution

  * 3440x1440p and up

3440x1440p is an industry standard for 21:9 ultrawides, so I will not accept anything lower.

### Aspect ratio

  * 21:9 (or other ultrawide)

21:9 is the standard aspect ratio for ultrawide monitors, but [alternative aspect ratios such as 32:9 exist](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-49-inch-Odyssey-FreeSync-LC49G95TSSNXZA/dp/B088HH6LW5?th=1), although these come at a high premium.

### Refresh rate
 
  * 75 Hz minimum (120+ Hz preferred)

 I was introduced to high refresh rate monitors in 2015 (?) when I bought the [Acer XG270HU 27" 1440p 144 Hz monitor](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-XG270HU-27-inch-FREESYNC-Widescreen/dp/B00VRCLHYS). I am now forever spoiled by high refresh rates, and will not accept lower than 75 Hz on a primary monitor.

### I/O

  * DisplayPort 2.0
  * Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C)
  * Monitor USB hub minimum, KVM switch ideal

I would like this monitor to be used for my desktop and my laptop, which will use the DisplayPort and Thunderbolt 4 inputs respectively. These protocols should support the max resolution and refresh rate at the same time. With a KVM (keyboard video mouse) switch to use the same peripherals between my desktop and laptop, switching between my desktop, personal and work laptops should be seamless.

## Options

### The Premium Option: [LG 40WP95C-W](https://www.amazon.com/LG-40WP95C-W-UltraWide-Thunderbolt-Borderless/dp/B09P1VLCQ4)

![](https://www.lg.com/us/images/monitors/md08001731/gallery/medium02.jpg)

#### Specifications

* Display size
  * 40" curved IPS &check;
* Resolution
  * 5120x2160p &check;
* Aspect ratio
  * 21:9 &check;
* Refresh rate 
  * 72 Hz
* I/O
  * Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) x2 &check;
  * DisplayPort x1 &check;
  * HDMI x2

This is the first ultrawide monitor to feature Thunderbolt 4 compatibility, and the only one as of this post. Despite this, the 40WP95C-W runs at 72 Hz, which admittedly is better than 60 Hz, but would be lackluster coming from a 144 Hz display, especially for gaming.

Another unique feature is the "5K2K" resolution, essentially making this 4K monitor with extra real estate along the horizontal axis (3840x2160p).

With these features comes a feature-worthy price of about $1800 USD. At this price point, I would like a built-in KVM switch, which is absent from this mode. Considering this price point does not offer every feature I'm looking for, other options will be explored.
  
### One Step Down: [LG 38WN95C-W](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0892MHG9H?tag=amazondn01-20)

![](https://www.lg.com/us/images/monitors/md07500041/gallery/medium02.jpg)

#### Specifications

* Display size
  * 38" curved IPS &check;
* Resolution
  * 3840x1600p &check;
* Aspect ratio
  * 21:9 &check;
* Refresh rate 
  * 144 Hz &check;
* I/O
  * Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) x1
  * DisplayPort x1 &check;
  * HDMI x2

The 38WN95C-W appears to be the younger brother of the 40WP95C-W, with a slightly smaller screen, a lower resolution, and Thunderbolt 4, but offers a 144 Hz refresh rate. The only notable omissions on this model are Thunderbolt 4 and a KVM switch, but results in a current price of $1400 USD.

This appears to be a decent value, though we should explore other brands.

### The Premium Option (#2): [Dell UltraSharp U4021QW](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-U4021QW-UltraSharp-40-inch-Monitor/dp/B091BJ4CKX)

![](https://i.dell.com/is/image/DellContent//content/dam/images/products/electronics-and-accessories/dell/monitors/ultrasharp/u4021qw/u4021qw-cfp-00000ff090-sl.psd?fmt=pjpg&pscan=auto&scl=1&hei=402&wid=613&qlt=100,0&resMode=sharp2&size=613,402)

#### Specifications

* Display size
  * 40" curved IPS &check;
* Resolution
  * 5120x2160p &check;
* Aspect ratio
  * 21:9 &check;
* Refresh rate 
  * 60 Hz &#x2717;
* I/O
  * Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) x1
  * DisplayPort x1 &check;
  * HDMI x2

For those who take offense to the slogan "Life's Good", the U40210W has very similar specs to the 40WP95C-W, though it lacks Thunderbolt 4 and has a peasantly 60 Hz panel. Given that this offering is actually *more* expensive than the LG option at $2000 USD, I would only consider this monitor if the LG one was out of stock.
