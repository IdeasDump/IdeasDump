title: Grad School Admission
---

As of July 8<sup>th</sup>, I've been admitted to the University of Washington's online Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering! After watching [Steve Brunton's YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm5mt-A4w61lknZ9lCsZtBw) that showcase UW's online learning resources, the school became my top choice for part-time graduate studies.

Online students have more limited access to curriculum, but courses such as ME 564 - Mechanical Engineering Analysis, AMATH 502 - Introduction to Dynamical Systems and Chaos, and AMATH 585 - Numerical Analysis of Boundary Value Problems are sufficient for my interests.

Starting classes must result in a lifestyle change on my part. As things are right now, I'll wake up around 7-7:30am, get to work around 8-8:30am, leave around 4-4:30pm, waste time until around 10pm, then repeat the cycle. I'm not sure whether I should wake up around 5:30-6am to accommodate studying or block off time after work. I have very limited energy after work, which makes me inclined to wake up earlier, that's a challenge in itself. My hope is that online courses will coincide with more remote-friendly activities at work, so I can stay at home. I'll have to upgrade my battlestation if that's the case, and I'd be excited to document my changes (stay tuned?).
