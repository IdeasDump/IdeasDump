I've been drawn towards more pure mathematics lately to expand my knowledge base. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and hopefully a M.S. in Applied Mathematics soon. I work on the Math/PDE team at a company that developes mathematical computing software.

Undergraduate STEM degrees provide a broad survey of many diciplines, but I want to specialize. Earlier I had gained interest in quantum computation, particularly with circuit optimizations, and the deeper mathematics has encouraged me to pursue more rigorous analysis tools.
